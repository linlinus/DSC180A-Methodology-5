# Questions

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

I enjoyed learning about how clustering corpuses together has progressed over the past few years, especially with the emergence of ChatGPT.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

I haven't decided on a single project I want to pursue next quarter, but an idea that I'm considering has to do with training a large language model to produce a resume, given a user's input of their background and accomplishments.

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

My quarter 1 project had to do with simply replicating similar results that were produced before.  This had to do with matching micro and macro F1-scores after performing two different methods of clustering.  For my quarter 2 project, I would likely not use F1-scores to quantify the success of the project, but rather a subjective judgement of its visual appearance. 

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I am interested in using NLP to transform conversational text-based user input into another medium.
